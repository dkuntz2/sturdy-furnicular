# Sturdy Furnicular

Sturdy Furnicular is a collaborative jukebox, meant to be setup and streamed
to multiple people, or played over a local sound system.

Sturdy Furnicular is designed to replace
[jukebox2](https://github.com/thehammer/jukebox2), and is a fork of
[Turbo Wookie](https://github.com/thehammer/jukebox2). It is currently under
development to give it closer functional pairity with jukebox2.

On the current roadmap is:

- [ ] Some backend changes to make life generally nicer for anyone hacking on
  this

- [ ] Easy song uploading, instead of manually placing them in mpd's music
  directory on whatever server is running Sturdy Furnicular

- [ ] Disabling tracks, so that people can turn off particularly annoying tracks
  from the randomizer (users would still be able to manually add them to
  playlists)

- [ ] A revamped frontend, with different focuses, because Turbo Wookie was
  built with different goals in mind
